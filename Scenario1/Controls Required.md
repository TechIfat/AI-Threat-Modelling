# AI Security Controls Required for IntelliChat Pro

**Controls Required:**

- Regular AI model security audits specifically targeting the IntelliChat Pro system to detect prompt injection vulnerabilities and model drift.
- Patch management for Amazon Bedrock runtime, foundation models, and custom fine-tuned models to ensure protection against known AI vulnerabilities.
- Comprehensive employee training on AI prompt security awareness to educate users about prompt injection risks and social engineering through AI.
- Implementation of AI-specific Web Application Firewall (WAF) with prompt filtering capabilities tailored to the IntelliChat Pro application.
- Deployment of Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) enhanced with AI-based behavioral analysis for identity verification.
- Continuous AI model monitoring to detect adversarial inputs, model drift, and anomalous behavior patterns.
- Implementation of Role-based Access Control (RBAC) with AI context awareness within IntelliChat Pro to limit access to sensitive knowledge bases based on user identity and clearance levels.
- AI prompt sanitization and input validation to prevent injection attacks and malicious prompt manipulation.
- Model provenance tracking and supply chain security for all AI components including foundation models and training datasets.
- Real-time output filtering and data loss prevention to prevent sensitive information disclosure through AI responses.
- Implementation of rate limiting and resource monitoring to prevent AI model denial of service attacks.
- Establishment of AI-specific incident response procedures for prompt injection and model compromise scenarios.
- Deployment of vector database access controls to prevent unauthorized access to knowledge base content.
- Implementation of context isolation mechanisms to prevent cross-user information leakage in AI conversations.
- Regular training data validation and sanitization to prevent data poisoning attacks on fine-tuned models.
